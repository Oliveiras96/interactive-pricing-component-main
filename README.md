# Overview

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Page view and pricing totals:

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

# What I Learned

For this project I learned how to work with *range* and *checkbox* inputs and
it's styles. I also applyed some CSS grid template area. Last, used Javascript
to manipulate some information on the page.

It sems like a pretty basic project, but I am very satisfied with the results.
